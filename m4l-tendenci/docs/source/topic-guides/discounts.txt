Discounts
=========

Setting up discount codes is a quick and painless process which can be applied to several apps within Tendenci.


Enable discounts
----------------

Discounts come enabled by default, but check at https://example.com/settings/module/discounts/#id_enabled to ensure they are current set to 'enabled'.


Configure discountable apps
---------------------------

Next configure the apps you would like to have discounts apply to - some examples below.

Memberships
^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure the "Discount eligible" is ticked on the relevant memberships applications (ex: https://www.example.com/admin/memberships/membershipapp/1/).

Events
^^^^^^

To find the discount option tick 'Enable Registration' and make sure the "Discount eligible" is ticked when creating an Event (ex: https://demo.tendenci.com/events/add/ ).


Adding discount codes
---------------------

Once the applications are configured to allow discounts they will appear in the 'Applications' list when issuing a discount code via https://www.example.com/discounts/add/ . Choose the applications you'd like to apply discounts to when creating the discount code.
