Recurring Payments
==================

Tendenci supports recurring payments when using `Stripe`_ or `Authorize.net`_ as the payment gateway.

.. _`Stripe`: https://stripe.com
.. _`Authorize.net`: https://www.authorize.net

The steps for configuring recurring payments are covered on other pages, but there are some things to note before you can proceed.

Tendenci 7.4.1 or greater is required. See the `upgrade documentation`_ for more details on updating.

.. _`upgrade documentation`: http://tendenci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade/point-update.html

.. NOTE::
  If you want to know how to configure your tendenci.com payments see https://www.tendenci.com/help-files/recurring-payment-help/


Setting up
----------
Setting up the payment gateway is covered in help file `Setting Up Online Payment and your Merchant Provider on a Tendenci Site`_ and auto renew with Stripe is detailed on `a separate page`_.

.. _`Setting Up Online Payment and your Merchant Provider on a Tendenci Site`: https://www.tendenci.com/help-files/configure-online-payments-merchant-provider-tendenci/
.. _`a separate page`: https://www.tendenci.com/help-files/how-enable-memberships-auto-renew-stripe/

.. TIP::
  If you create a recurring payment but your system is incorrectly configured you will need to delete the recurring payment and create a new entry.

Updating Payment Methods
------------------------

The point of recurring payments is to allow members to opt in when performing payments, but this requires one more step be performed.

Depending on if there is already an 'online' Payment Method listed at https://example.com/admin/payments/paymentmethod/ ('online' means using your merchant account) you will either need to add a new entry, or potentially rename the existing 'Is online' payment entry (for example a rename might be required if you changed your merchant from PayPal to Stripe). Membership Applications will update to the new names automatically.

.. WARNING::
    Do not delete your existing 'Is online' method and create a new 'Is online' method of payment. Deleting the existing method will remove all memberships that were paid using that method.

Help on changing your Payment Methods can be done using `help for the memberships app`_ already available on the Tendenci site, including `a video for a more visual guide`_ if you prefer.

Testing
--------

Stripe and Authorize.net manage their test systems differently. For Stripe, the procedure is to use a special `test only access key`_ while Authorize.net use `different API endpoints`_. Be sure you adjust your settings appropriately for the endpoint you have chosen!
