Thank you to our current core developers adding issues, pull requests, documentation and helping the community. Without idealistic people working on this open source project and trying to change the world, Tendenci would not be possible.

If you know of someone who should be added to this list and deserves credit, cause we are human and it's hard to keep up, please TELL US! For example someone active on Transifex doing translations, or adding documentation, they are just as appreciated as people submitting issues and pull requests.

PS - A particular "thank you" call out to @goetzk who posted the feedback that reminded me this file existed. Thank you Karl for posting https://github.com/goetzk/tendenci-community/blob/master/community-engagement.rst - and you are correct. I need to do better. I'm learning still, and probably always will be learning from y'all.
