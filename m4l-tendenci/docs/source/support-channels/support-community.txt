Community support
=================

There are a number of possible ways to interact with the Tendenci community,
they are listed in approximately descending order of immediacy.


Community Matrix.org channel
----------------------------

Several members of the Tendenci community use a channel - tendenci-dev - on
Matrix.org for closer-to-real-time discussion. They can be joined via the `Riot
web client`_ or an installed app of your choice.

GitHub
------

Tendenci has a number of repositories hosted on GitHub and their issue trackers
can be used for user support where needed though the preferred location for most
issues is the `Tendenci`_ repository.

GitHub should also be used for queries related to development of Tendenci.

.. _Tendenci: https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/issues


Forum for other discussion
--------------------------

If you would like a forum instead, Tendenci `offers a forum`_ on their domain.
The forum can't be subscribed to, so there is an element of chance whether
someone will see a post.
