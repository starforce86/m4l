Running and Writting Tests
==========================

Test, test, test! There is no need for us to stress how important testing is - everybody knows that. 

We think both manual testing and automated testing are important.
Manual testing can not be completely replaced by automated testing.
There are many cases you would want to run manual tests.
Automated testing can help us run manual tests more efficiently. Therefore,
if applicable, please test thoroughly as an anonymous user, a logged-in user, a member 
and a super user, respectively, for your new features or updates to ensure they work as expected.
 

Running Tests
-------------
To run automated testing in Tendenci, just type the following command and run in your dev environment.
::

    python manage.py test tendenci
    
 

Writing Tests
-------------

You can write your test cases in the tests.py in an app, or use the following testing structure. 
::

    app_name
        tests
             __init__.py
             test_forms.py
             test_models.py
             test_views.py
